        <p  class="about-us-p">
            Various electronic devices are closely related to our modern life. The development of communication system around the world has increased so much that now the world is at hand. Which is actually impossible without electronics or electronics engineer. Electronics engineering deals with the study of electromagnetic spectrum and its applications in integrated circuits, transistors, electronic devices. Electronics engineers mainly design and develop various electronic devices such as TVs, refrigerators, mobile phones, computers, etc. Besides, they do the manufacturing and development of telecommunication robotics, hardware, power, electrical equipment.

            Diploma in Electronics Engineering Diploma is a branch of engineering which imparts theoretical and practical knowledge about various subjects of electronics. Electronics engineering deals with electrical issues such as circuits, electrical engineering components, power electronics, embedded systems, advanced instrumentation systems, electrical and electronic machines, and measurement issues.
<br>
By studying Food Technology under Board of Technical Education, students will learn about food quality control, nutritional quality, nutritional deficiency diseases and remedies, food export and import laws, food biochemistry, biochemistry, food microbiology, food processing and preservation etc. Some studies have shown that the food processing sector of Bangladesh will increase by more than 10 percent in the next 2 to 3 years.

            <p class="about-us-p">At present 4 years diploma-in-engineering education program is being conducted in Electrical Technology. </p>

              <p class="about-us-p">This four-year education course consists of a total of eight semesters including an “Industrial Attachment Training” of one semester of six months duration to be completed in various establishments. According to the rules of Bangladesh Technical Education Institute, after completing this course of eight semesters with industrial training, he is awarded the "Diploma-in-Engineering" certificate of a specific technology. After passing diploma-in-engineering there are opportunities to take up prestigious jobs or trades of choice. The academic recognition of the diploma course is external so a diploma engineer gets the opportunity to work abroad as a middle class engineer rather than a general labourer.</p>

<br>
              Currently the food processing sector is becoming very modern. The survey shows that the demand for processed and packaged food is increasing at a very fast pace. As a result, the number of food processing plants is increasing in the country to cater to that demand. As a result, the overall size and number of food processing industry is increasing. As a result, many livelihood opportunities are created naturally.
              <br>
              After completing the diploma, students can get admission for B.Sc Engineering degree in Chemical and Food Engineering at Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology, Gazipur. Besides, many private universities including Bangladesh Open University get higher education opportunities.
